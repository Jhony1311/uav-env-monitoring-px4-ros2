# UAV Environmental Monitoring – PX4 + ROS 2 Jazzy

This repository contains a UAV simulation for environmental monitoring using PX4 SITL, Gazebo Harmonic, and ROS 2 Jazzy.

## Stack
- Ubuntu 24.04
- ROS 2 Jazzy
- PX4 SITL
- Gazebo Harmonic

## Goal
Demonstrate autonomous UAV area coverage for environmental monitoring and sustainability-oriented applications.

## Status
Work in progress. Initial structure and ROS 2 offboard control nodes are under development.

## Planned Features
- PX4 offboard control via ROS 2
- Area coverage (lawnmower pattern)
- Gazebo Harmonic environment
- Simulation-to-real readiness
